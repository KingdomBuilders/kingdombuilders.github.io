Serving and growing the Kingdom of God with every tool, skill, and opportunity available to us.

## This Repository

Kingdom Builders is a Slack community, and our goal is to band together to work on technology projects that glorify God, serve people in need, and grow the Kingdom of God.

[Our website](http://kingdombuilders.io) is a jekyll site, and this repository houses the code!
