# About Kingdom Builders

### Vision

> To connect Christ-following technologists, developers, inventors, and
> enthusiasts to one another, and to the missions and ministries that need their
> talents.

### Mission

> To serve and grow the Kingdom of God with every tool, skill, and opportunity
> available to us.

> To meet the unmet needs with no stone unturned.

> To do everything, always to the glory of God.

### Purpose

**Kingdom Builders** has one goal: bringing together followers of Christ from
modern technology fields, so they can encourage one another, band together, and
drive forward projects that solve real needs.

Sometimes we wonder what God wants us to use our skills for, why he made us with
the abilities we have. It can be hard to find a place; it's not often someone
stands up in church and says *"I need volunteers for this Saturday, and you need
to know JavaScript,"* or *"We're starting a new small group this summer, bring
your own Arduino!"*

Without a doubt, we *can* be a huge asset to ministry and missions, but the
conversation needs a volume boost. With a lively and interactive community,
we find teammates, brainstorm together, and discover problems we can solve,

As iron sharpens iron, we will make each other better servants of the Kingdom.

### What it's **Not**
<a name="what-its-not"></a>

**Kingdom Builders** is not a company. It's not a consultancy, a recruiting
agency, or a development team.

We aren't here to be the name that owns products, to provide infrastructure
or funding for projects.

If you kickstart a project through Kingdom Builders, we won't try
to take any credit; your project is yours!

Our goal is *conversation*. We want people to share, collaborate, and
get each other excited!
