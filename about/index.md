# About Kingdom Builders

### Vision

> To connect Christ-following technologists, developers, inventors, and enthusiasts to one another, and to the missions and ministries that need their talents.

### Mission

> To serve and grow the Kingdom of God with every tool, skill, and opportunity available to us.

> To meet the unmet needs with no stone unturned.

> To do everything, always to the glory of God.

### Purpose

**Kingdom Builders** exists with one intention: bringing together all the followers of Christ from the modern technology fields, from software to hardware, so they can encourage one another, band together, and drive forward projects that solve real needs in our world.

Sometimes we wonder what God wants us to use our skills for, why he made us with the abilities he did. It can be hard to find a place; it's not often someone stands up in church and says "I need volunteers for this Saturday, and *you need to know JavaScript*," or "We're starting a new small group this summer, bring your own Arduino!"

There's no question that we can be a huge asset to the work of ministry and missions, but we've found that the conversation needs a volume boost. With a lively and interactive community, we're better able to find teammates, brainstorm together, discover problems we can solve, and, as iron sharpens iron, make each other better servants of the Kingdom.
