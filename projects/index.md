# Projects

Kingdom Builders [is not a development team](/about#what-its-not) and we don't directly lead or sponsor individual projects. But as a community of technologists, it's no surprise that members have projects of their own!

Below is a list of projects that are led or contributed to by members of Kingdom Builders

* PrayerMate
* [Kingdom Builders](https://github.com/KingdomBuilders/kingdombuilders.github.io) - sort of a cheat, but hey, this website is a software project! Promoting the community and inviting others to join. Uses [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).
